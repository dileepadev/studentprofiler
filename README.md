# Student Profiler – Demo

This is a demo repository showcasing an AI/ML-based system for analyzing student behavior and learning patterns using the **VARK learning model**.

This repository is a **public demo** derived from the main **Student Profiler** project, which is maintained as a **private project**.

## About the Project

Student Profiler focuses on understanding how students learn and behave by combining:

* Behavioral data analysis with video analysis and human observation
* Learning-style classification
* AI/ML-driven insights

The system uses the **VARK model** (Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, Kinesthetic) to help identify preferred learning styles and support better educational decision-making.

## What This Demo Includes

This demo repository provides:

* Sample project structure
* Example data flows and logic
* Simplified AI/ML concepts used in the system
* Demonstration code safe for public sharing

> [!NOTE]
> This is **not** the full production system.
> Advanced features, datasets, models, and integrations are intentionally excluded.

## Acronym

**SBVARKS** = **S**tudent **B**ehavior and **VARK** **S**ystem

## Purpose of This Repository

This demo is mainly intended for:

* Developers exploring the project concept
* Academic or research reference
* Documentation and learning purposes
